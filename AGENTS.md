# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview
This is a Python CLI tool to fetch Google Keep notes using the unofficial `gkeepapi` library. It handles authentication (including OAuth token exchange) and exports data to Pandas DataFrames and CSV files.

## Setup & Build
- **Environment**: Python 3.7+ with a virtual environment (`venv`).
- **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Run application**: `./venv/bin/python3 main.py`

## Code Style
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
    - `gkeepapi` for Google Keep interaction.
    - `gpsoauth` for authentication.
    - `pandas` for data manipulation and export.
- **Authentication**: Always handle `BadAuthentication` errors by offering the alternative OAuth token flow.
- **Data**: Use Pandas DataFrames for structured data handling.

## Commit Message Convention

All commit messages generated by the agent **MUST** follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

**Format:**
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Allowed Types:**
-   `feat`: A new feature
-   `fix`: A bug fix
-   `docs`: Documentation only changes
-   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
-   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   `perf`: A code change that improves performance
-   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
-   `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

**Rules:**
1.  The description must be concise and in the imperative mood (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature").
2.  Breaking changes must be indicated by an `!` after the type/scope or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
3.  If a commit closes an issue, include `Closes #<issue-number>` in the footer.
